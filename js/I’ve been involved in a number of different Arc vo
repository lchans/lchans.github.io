I’ve been involved in a number of different Arc volunteer programs; namely as a member of societies, as well as with Arc Street Team for the past two semesters. In this role I was in a capacity to represent Arc to the rest of the student body; particularly during the O-Week in both semesters. What I loved most about volunteering for Arc are the amazing people that I got to meet; both in the program and the other people who I got to talk to while running the event. As a student development officer, I feel that the the energetic and fun environment is a place where I can really thrive in, I’m a strong believer in a being able to love your work, and I feel that with such an amazing team, I can definitely see myself putting 110% into the role. On another note, without Arc there would not be any student clubs on campus. I was able to form many close bonds with people who I have met through clubs. As a Student Development Officer, I really want to be able to facilitate the formation of new clubs on campus; so students are able to meet more people and to develop important skills like leadership and cooperation.
