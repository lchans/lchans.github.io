						<h11>Who am I?</h11><br>
			I’m Lavender, a dog lover, a food lover, and a 3rd year (soon to be 4th year) Software Engineering student.
			Ever since first year, I’ve been involved with CSESoc in some form or another. Without this society, and the amazing teams in the past that have lead its success, I definitely wouldn’t be the person that I am today. Now, it’s time to give back.

			<h8>Experience in CSESoc ...</h8><br>
				
				2014 ------------------------------------<br>
				I was CSESoc’s <b>Arc Delegate</b>. I was responsible for ensuring that procedures and rules were met, booking areas for our events around campus, and getting $$ from Arc to sponsor all the cool events throughout the year.<br>
				2015 ------------------------------------<br>
				In 2015, I was CSESoc’ <b>Publicity Head</b> - I was responsible in organising a team to make the snazzy designs and merch for CSESoc’s events. <br><br>
				By extension, I’ve also been a <b>First Year Camp Leader</b> in 2014 and 2015, as well as a <b>Student mentor</b> in 2014. It’s safe to say that I know CSESoc inside and out and how to effectively run things to make for a smooth sailing year.

		<h8>... & Other Societies</h8><br>
			
			This year I've been a Clubs and Volunteering Officer at Arc - I'm in charge of everything that goes on between Arc and a society - Think AGM's, $$ for events, registering new societies, you name it. I've also been heavily involved with CSE Revue and Med Revue. <br><br>With all of this involvement in clubs outside of CSESoc, I've got a first hand (and fresh) perspective on all the different ways that societies are run. CSESoc has been an absolutely fantastic society, but there is always room for improvement, and I hope to use my experiences to further CSESoc into being a greater society.

		I want to ensure that our members can get the most out of our strong relationship with our sponsors. I want to make sure that sponsors have the opportunity to come onto campus, allowing for <b>interaction on a more personal level</b>. By taking the society in this direction, this will create more meaningful and useful connections that will be useful for the career progression of our members.

				<h10>CSE Revue</h10><br></center>
		I hope to also <b>improve relations with CSE Revue</b>. Both societies are incredibly important in the personal development of CSE Students. A lot of teams (and members!) overlap between the two societies. I hope to have more <b>joint events between both societies</b>. It would not only provide valuable learning experiences for both organisers, but also gives a chance for people to meet one another in their respective societies.

	Increasing the involvement of women in computing is something that I feel passionate about. As president, I hope to <b>leverage CompClub's* existing workshops, connections, and people to reach out to more girls</b> in primary and high schools.<br>

				<h10>CSESoc + UNSW</h10><br></center>
		My experience in Arc has put me in contact with a lot of societies and people within the university. I hope to use this to increase <b>CSESoc’s presence within the UNSW community</b>. Whether it would be something small, like organising inter-society sports events in practice for Engsoc sports day or to utilising spaces like the Michael Crouch Innovation Centre (or the resources from it, at the very least) to further student creativity, especially in DevSpace.

	I hope to <b>increase the number of alumni talks and workshops</b> in CSESoc. Since it’s <b>CSESoc’s 10th birthday</b> next year - It would be amazing to get even more alumni to share their experiences after graduation, as well as teach any important skills that they’ve picked up along the way.
